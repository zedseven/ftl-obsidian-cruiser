I have permission from Kieve to publicly share my fixes for this mod:

![That's wonderful actually. It's a shame I haven't paid much attention to my old mods, but I appreciate you taking the time to fix it up for existing versions. You've got my blessing to release it publicly, if you like.

## Changes
- Updates for FTL v1.6.X
- Added Advanced Edition systems
- Fixed room glows
- Added missing station marker in Medbay
- Corrected small issues that show up with SMM's Validate feature (interlaced ship images, lack of transparency in Weapon room interior, invalid XML end tag for `gib1`, extraneous top-level file `KRS Obsidian Cruiser Readme.txt`)
- Added obsidian and red crystal colours to match the ship
- Removed duplicate copies of system interiors
- Moved the contents of the README into the mod description
- Fixed Doors and Sensors systems' stations
- Made the standard floor parts of room images transparent to make it easier to see the oxygen level of their rooms
